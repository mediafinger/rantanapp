# Nav Layouts

Are currently a mess, cleanup: `ApplicationNavComponent`.

## Admin Layout

* Works as expected and looks clean.
* Has it's own layout already.

## Current Team Layout

* This should become a specific section, the "create mode".
* Should not intermingle with the Teams / "browse mode".
* Should have it's own layout.
* Needs cleaning up of links and button placements.
* A user that has only one team should have it selected by default.
* A user with multiple teams should be able to select a default team.
* On login user should be switched to their default team (unless they have no default selected). 

## Team Layout

* This should be the default layout, aka "browse mode".
* It should provide links to:
  * Admin 
  * Current Team
  * Switch Team
  * Logout
  * Profile / Settings
* Need sorting out of links and button placements.
