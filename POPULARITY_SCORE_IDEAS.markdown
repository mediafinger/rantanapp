# Popularity Score Ideas

## Interaction points

* 1 point for every view
* 10 points for every (invisible) bookmark 🔖
* 10 points for very positive reactions: 👍 😄 ⭐ ❤️
* 7 points for engaged reactions: 😮 😢 🤔
* 5 points for shocked and angry reactions: 😱 😡
* -7 points for most negative reaction: 👎
* 20 points for every first comment by a user
* 60 points for every new follow
* 40 points for every first share by a user
* 10 points for every subsequent share by a user, capped to 5 shares in total
* when reactions change, points change
* when unfollowings happen, the points are removed

## All time points

* just add all the points together
* use it for general suggestions of popular content

## Recent points

* add only the new points of the last 14 days
* use it for suggestions of recent popular content

## Latest points

* add only the new points of the last 72 hours
* use it for suggestions of recent popular content

## Current Score

* something along the lines of:
* 10 x (latest points) + 5 x (recent points) + 1 x (all time points)
* but don't count points twice
* and ensure not to be too biased for the latest content
* while allowing recent popularity to influcene the current score of older content significantly

## Content category points

* add to the current score to not add novelity bias
* on first publishing of a Memory, award it 600 points
* on first publishing of a Chronicle, award it 800 points
* on first publishing of an Experience, award it 1200 points
* on first publishing of a Journey, award it 2000 points
* is this too biased towards longer content?
* remember idea to display memories in their own section

## Team popularity

* sum the all time points of all content published by the team ever
* do not use this to rank content, but to suggest popular teams?
* create a ranking of average percentage of popularity per piece of content? (to differentiate "spammers" from "high quality" creators)

## User preferences

While the popularity score can lead to an overall ranking, the content suggestions to the user should be influenced by their own preferences. Obviously positive reactions to specific content "tags" and teams should lead to more suggestions of those, while "thumbs down" should lead to less suggestions of this team.
